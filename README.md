etl
===

'E' Template Library (etl) is a collection of data structures and iterators.
It is written using e templates, and can be parametrized by most data types.

One of the goals of etl is to overcome existing limitations of regular/keyed list.
That's why the API is similar to list API, however is not 100% plug and play:
- access by index uses method syntax, not []
- many iterative pseudo-methods are not implemented, TBD for SN 14.2 using new syntax

For details look open etl_doc/index.html in a web browser.
